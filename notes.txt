center the words, also missing
see what is wrong for pdf, 
why it does not display right there
add spacing between stanzas, this did not work
same for translation, spacing missing




the code is not able to recognize where a song begins and ends. 
The reference for beginning of a song should be Y:
After Y: there is the title of the song. 

Then there are stanzas, sometimes stanzas resemble each other. the code should not bother about that but just consider it as stanza. 

The lyrics end where T: is mentioned. After that, if there is text, this is the translation. 
The translation ends whre Y: is mentioned. 

When producing the song output, there should be a blank line between stanzas, between title and first stanza, between last stanza and beginning of translation, 

And the words Lyrics, Translation, YouTube should be used instead of T: , Y: when displaying the final on the site and in the pdf. 

and the title, lyrics, everything should be displayed in the center of the site, 

now show me step by step where to make changes for all of these. 

sign in feature to add ilahi songs
and youtube links and translation

people can click on a button to suggest or give an ilahi
or to request an ilahi that is not there

youtube goes to links of other songs similar, 
various suggestions
and people can suggest too

show a model of what pdf page looks like
and it builds ours like that

people can generate their pdf with their own design
put a couple of design with flowers 
nature mountain etc 

and then to help singing
generate one with the alternative word style

call it singing assistance tool

put a button to join whatsapp group to learn singing with a community

people should be able to sign in
and get notifications when more songs are added
and when the translation is done
and when the youtube links are added
and when the ilahis are added
and when the pdf is generated
and when the pdf is downloaded
and when the pdf is shared
and when the pdf is printed
and when the pdf is deleted
