## Overview

The ilahi Book App is a comprehensive Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to serve poetry, historic content and texts to users worldwide. Built with modern web technologies, it provides an accessible, offline-capable platform for singing practices.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Framework
- **Vue 3** with Composition API for reactive, component-based architecture
- **TypeScript** for type safety and enhanced developer experience
- **Pinia** for state management across multiple stores (songs, poems, settings, navigation, theme)
- **Vue Router** for client-side navigation with deep linking support

### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **DaisyUI** for pre-built, accessible UI components
- **FontAwesome** for consistent iconography
- **Custom CSS** for specialized components and animations

### Build & Development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Rollup** with manual chunk splitting for optimal bundle sizes
- **PWA** capabilities via `vite-plugin-pwa` and Workbox
- **Service Workers** for offline functionality and caching

### Content Management
- **GitHub API** integration for dynamic content discovery
- **Firebase** (Firestore & Storage) for book metadata and file management
