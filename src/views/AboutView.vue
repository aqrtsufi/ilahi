        <p class="mb-4">Allah the Most High says in Qur'ani Karim, "Everything in the universe does Zikr of Allah but you would not be able to recognise it."</p>
        <p class="mb-4">So most of our Zikr movements are taken from nature and are designed to balance the body, to bring the soul and the body into oneness.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Importance of Ilahis</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">During Zikr, we sing Ilahis (songs) which are designed to provide motivation. These songs tell us of our philosophy, of the wisdom of Sufism.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">For example, one of them says: "You cannot reach the High Headquarters with vanity. You have to leave what you have and what you have not. Then, come."</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Each ilahi carries some lessons upon the Pirs and Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) and it tells stories about them to us. So, it is very important to know these ilahis. Every ilahi gives us information, but they have one thing in constant...it is love. Love to Allah is the constant, or love to the Prophet and the Pirs.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Praising Allah</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">In the ilahis, one is also mentioning the Beautiful Names of Allah, praising Allah! In this way, one is making Zikr.</p>

    <p>Now when you do the Zikr:</p>
    <p>empty your mind,</p>
    <p>connect yourself to the Energy</p>
    <p>and live some ecstasy.</p>
    <p>Live the Energy of Allah.</p>
