Your nafs is you. You, is what you want to be.
When you are what 'I' want you to be,
Then it is not you.
In the fight against your nafs, you forget the essence of things.
The essence of things is to enjoy Allah and to focus on Allah.
Love is the thing.
When you are in the fight, 
you need to make a habit of remembering Allah.
In the fight against your nafs, you need to remember Allah too.
You can bypass all these with the love you have in your heart
Your quest is to surrender your brain to your heart.`

  first He gives you the curiosity about it

  This means Allah is doing this.
  
  When you want to do something, 
  if it is not happening, 
  then, it means Allah does not want it. 
  This is not your thing.`
